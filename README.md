The following project is for the PilotCity Internship Program. Western Digital is the primary audience we would like to share this project with in hopes of getting an internship. We are Irvington High School students under the tutelage of Salwa Berbawy, founder of BerbawyMakers.


Scope:
Design and develop a file management software prototype for Western Digital, that leverages your engineering skills in coding and construction, to automatically sort, categorize and optimize data storage, addressing the challenge of managing large files and scarce storage space, potentially revolutionising data storage solutions for computer users and game enthusiasts worldwide

Ideate:
